# end-end-tensorflow-databricks
This project walks through an end-end usecase of fraud detection based on the popular opensource TensorFlow llibrary on the latest Databricks ML environment. We will utilize MLFlow to manage the model training lifecycle and versioning and ultimately packaging the model for deployment as a rest endpoint.
